..ehhm we just did .. most domain providers will offer email hosting with your new custom domain.. but we f\*&k'd up.. we changed the control to Cloudflare.. soo umm we need a 3rd party....

Gone are the days of gmail for custom domains.. well actually we still use it for bbiab.com .. but we were an early adopter .. when it was still free .. these day you're gonna have to cough up something like sub $10/mth .. still the better deal was in the past... 

So what can we use .. we're gonna suggest [Zoho][0].
