# yes to a name.. yes to ssl..

When you create your new grid site, first you give it a name.. pick a site color.. and then you have the option to 'purchase' a custom domain name..

For every site you have on the grid you can get a free domain for the first year through their partnership with [Uniregistry][0]. So it seems to make perfect sense to take the opportunity to grab that muchloveddomain.com right now. 

In fact if you don't do it now.. you do don't get the chance again. The only way would be to use another of your sites to acquire the domain.. hence using up another site..

BUT.. is Uniregistry the right place to get your domain.. it's free for the first year, but check the renewal fee for the 2nd year. Depending on the type of domain - .com / .io / .us - it maybe cheaper to go elsewhere..

For [abc-xyz.us][1] we used [Namecheap][2] as the domain provider, as in the long run it worked out cheaper :

* Uniregistry - it maybe a free domain .. but then the yearly renewal is $10.88
* Namecheap - it was only 88 cents... then yearly renewal of $8.48

After the break.. how to set it up so that it points to your grid site, and how to set up SSL through [Cloudflare][3].

So now that we have our unique domain we can login to our domain providers account, and make the necessary changes.
