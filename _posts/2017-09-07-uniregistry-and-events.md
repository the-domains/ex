# uniregistry and events ?

You've got 10 sites with LT Membership, so let's use some. One idea we like is combining one off events to create a site, and then using [Uniregistry][0] to get your 'free' domain to help promote it.

Once the event is over, you can delete the site, ready for the next one.. and we can forget about the last custom url - we can just get another one for the next event! We're not going to renew the domain at the end of the year, well unless it was a good one, so it truly is free.. no excuse then to using the grid and uniregistry to promote your next event.

More after the break, including the extensions that are free..

So here are the free domain extenstions that you can get :

* blackfriday
* christmas
* click
* diet
* flowers
* guitars
* help
* hiv
* link
* lol
* mom
* photo
* pics
* property
* sexy
* tattoo

There's some pretty good one there like dot photo. If you get that one, you may want to think about renewing that domain.

But for fun, we created a one off event site.. and so went with...

🎅🏻 🤶🏼 🎄 ☃️ 🎁

Yep, that commonly overlooked domain dot christmas - we might even renew this one!

Go wild... go create sites!
